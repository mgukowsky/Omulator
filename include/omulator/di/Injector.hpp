/**
 * A class responsible for dependency injection. Can be used as a global service locator, but need
 * not be treated as a singleton. Types managed by the injector need not be aware of this injector,
 * as dependencies are injected via constructors.
 *
 * Types managed by the injector must be move-constructible (e.g. so they can be moved out of the
 * recipe function where they are created), but need not be copy-constructible. Given this
 * limitation, it is important to note that types which cannot be efficiently moved (i.e.
 * std::array) should be given consideration when being managed and/or created by this class. In the
 * case of std::array, a better solution would be to instead manage a wrapper class which
 * dynamically allocates an instance of the std::array as a member, meaning that the move operation
 * can be more efficiently as a simple pointer move.
 *
 * Instances of a given type are lazily created as they are requested with Injector#get, or
 * repeatedly created using Injector#creat. Type instances are creating using "recipes", which are
 * callbacks that return a type-erasing Container_t and receive the instance of the injector on
 * which the get() or creat() methods were invoked. While it is perfectly acceptible for a recipe to
 * return a Container_t directly, it is recommended to wrap the new instance of type T created by
 * the recipe using Injector#containerize and have the recipe return this wrapped value.
 *
 * Injector instances contain an internal table of these recipe functions which are used to
 * instantiate type instances. If a recipe for a given type T has been added via addRecipes, that
 * recipe will be invoked when an instance of type T is requested (either when creat() is called or
 * the first time get<T>() is invoked for type T).
 *
 * If a recipe is default-initializable, the injector does not need to have a recipe for it. As
 * such, if an instance of type T is requested and no recipe for T has been added, the injector will
 * attempt to default-initialize T. If this fails, the injector will throw an error indicating that
 * it has no recipe for T and that T is not default initializable.
 *
 * For types that are not default-initializable but have a simple constructor, the
 * addCtorRecipe()<T, ...Ts> method can be used to automatically add a recipe for type T which will
 * call the constructor T((Ts)...). For TDep in Ts, the injector will call get() if TDep is an
 * lvalue reference type, otherwise creat() will be called to create a new instance of (decayed)
 * TDep.
 *
 * It is also possible for the type to hold a polymorphic interface bound to a specific
 * implementation using the bindImpl() method. Once bindImpl() is invoked, subsequent calls to get()
 * will return a reference to the given interface pointing to the given implementation (N.B. that
 * creat() should not be used with an interface type if it is an abstract class).
 *
 * Lastly, get() and creat() will throw an exception if a circular dependency is detected (e.g. T
 * invokes the constructor of U, which invokes the constructor of T, etc.)
