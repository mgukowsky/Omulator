/**
 * A class responsible for dependency injection. Can be used as a global service locator, but need
 * not be treated as a singleton. Types managed by the injector need not be aware of this injector,
 * as dependencies are injected via constructors.
 *
 * Instances of a given type are lazily created as they are requested with Injector#get, or
 * repeatedly created using Injector#creat. Type instances are creating using "recipes", which are
 * callbacks that return a pointer to a (usually newly allocated) instance of a given type T, and
 * receive the instance of the injector on which the get() or creat() methods were invoked.
 *
 * Injector instances contain an internal table of these recipe functions which are used to
 * instantiate type instances. If a recipe for a given type T has been added via addRecipe, that
 * recipe will be invoked when an instance of type T is requested (either when creat() is called or
 * the first time get<T>() is invoked for type T).
 *
 * If a recipe is default-initializable, the injector does not need to have a recipe for it. As
 * such, if an instance of type T is requested and no recipe for T has been added, the injector will
 * attempt to default-initialize T. If this fails, the injector will throw an error indicating that
 * it has no recipe for T and that T is not default initializable.
 *
 * For types that are not default-initializable but have a simple constructor, the
 * addCtorRecipe()<T, ...Ts> method can be used to automatically add a recipe for type T which will
 * call the constructor T((Ts)...). For TDep in Ts, the injector will call get() if TDep is an
 * lvalue reference type, otherwise creat() will be called to create a new instance of (decayed)
 * TDep.
 *
 * Injectors also have the ability to create a 'child' Injector: a parent ('upstream')
 * Injector will create a new Injector instance (the 'downstream') instance via a call to
 * Injector::creat<Injector>() (N.B. that a call to Injector::get<Injector>() will simply act as an
 * identity function and return a reference to the Injector which receives the call). This changes
 * the behavior of Injector::get and Injector::creat in the child Injector. If the child Injector
 * does not contain a reference to the desired type when Injector::get is called, then the call will
 * be forwarded to the parent Injector. If the parent Injector does not contain a reference to the
 * desired type, then the child Injector will follow the same logic to obtain a reference as it
 * would otherwise. If the parent Injector does have a reference to the desired type, then that
 * reference (still managed by the parent Injector!) will be returned. Injector::creat is affected
 * similarly: if the child Injector does not have a recipe for the desired type, then the parent
 * Injector will be searched for the desired recipe. N.B. that there is a special case for
 * Injector::get if neither the parent nor the child has an instance of the type BUT the parent has
 * a recipe for the type and the child does not: in such a case the parent's recipe will be used to
 * create the instance of the type, but it will be managed by the CHILD.
 *
 * It is also possible for the type to hold a polymorphic interface bound to a specific
 * implementation using the bindImpl() method. Once bindImpl() is invoked, subsequent calls to get()
 * will return a reference to the given interface pointing to the given implementation (N.B. that
 * creat() should not be used with an interface type if it is an abstract class).
 *
 * Lastly, get() and creat() will throw an exception if a circular dependency is detected (e.g. T
 * invokes the constructor of U, which invokes the constructor of T, etc.)
